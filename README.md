__Mapping__

learning objectives:
* breaking down problem spaces
* mapping the problem space into boolean conditionals
* covering all paths with test cases
* boolean expressions <-> conditional structures

exercise: given a word problem
1. describe elements of the domain in logical relationships
2. transform those relationships into conditional structures
3. write test cases to cover all paths
4. refactor into expressions


__Refactoring__

Learning Objectives
* how & when to refactor conditionals
* factor out the bodies if each one is responsible for a different problem-space path
    * ie. each condition does something quite different. (different functions)
* factor out the whole statement if it is completing the same step differently
    * ie. each condition does the same task a little differently. (one whole function)

exercise:
* given a snippet of code using conditionals, refactor it

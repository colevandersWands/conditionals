# Testing Utilities

There are 2 additional functions you will use for the truth table exercises:
* truth_table( tests [, exp\_func] )
* gen\_cases\_from\_exp( exp\_func )
* (figure out how to make underscore vars work in consolemd)

Using these functions you wil be able to: 
* display a truth table for given test cases using the 'expected' values
* display a truth table for given test cases by passing the args through the function
* generate comprehensive test cases for a given expression (wrapped in a function)

Check out the source for 'what-are-they.js' in the inspector to see how these are used.
